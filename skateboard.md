#Learning Objectives

1. How to story map
2. Sketch a small map
3. Critique the Scholarships story map

--

#Who should Story Map?

Everyone who knows the process ... Not Just Developers

--

#What is a Story Map?

A diagram of a project that identifies the stories of the people and systems involved in a process.

Detail is added as we learn more about the project

The project can be an existing application or a new application.

--
#Why Story Map?

- Build shared understanding
- Encourage discovery before implementation
- Include all stakeholders in the discussion
- Organize work to be done

--

#The big picture

#When to Story Map?

- When you have questions about an application or process

- When you begin new work

- Preferably before you being development

--

#Where?

A large, clear wall or whiteboard.

--

#You'll need

- painter's tape
- markers
- post-its (many colors)

--

#Thorough Discovery Up Front

- Understand the full process
  - Understand "why" steps are needed in the process
  - Talk about things inside and outside of the app
- Simplify and lower risk at implementation
  - Lowers the questions at the phase of implementation
  - Limits Feature Creep (beginning implementation w/o understanding, new features come in)
- Better estimates

Discovery is cheaper at the beginning of a project, than during implementation

--

#Focus on Goals and Outcomes

- Prioritize features based on the problem they solve
- Implement only what solves the problem or meets the objective

(instead of perceived importance)

### A textual example

Content can be written in **Markdown!** New lines no longer need two angle brackets.

This will be in a separate paragraph

--

### A list of things

* Item 1
* Item B
* Item gamma

No need for multiple templates!
