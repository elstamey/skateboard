##What we will learn

1. How to build a story map
2. We will build a small map
3. We will talk about a project that used this technique

#Why use User Story Mapping?

- Builds shared understanding
- Encourages Discovery before Implementation
- Includes all stakeholders in the discussion
- Organizes work to be done

--

#Thorough Discovery Up Front

- Understand the full process
  - Understand "why" steps are needed in the process
  - Talk about things inside and outside of the app
- Simplify and lower risk at implementation
  - Lowers the questions at the phase of implementation
  - Limits Feature Creep (beginning implementation w/o understanding, new features come in)
- Better estimates

Discovery is cheaper at the beginning of a project, than during implementation

--

#Focus on Goals and Outcomes

- Prioritize features based on the problem they solve
- Implement only what solves the problem or meets the objective

(instead of perceived importance)
