##Ripped from the pages of (not really)

![User Story Mapping by Jeff Patton](img/book.jpg)
--

#Learning Objectives

1. How to story map
2. Sketch a small map
3. Critique the Scholarships story map

-- 

#Who should Story Map?

Everyone who knows the process ... Not Just Developers

--

#What is a Story Map?

A diagram of a project that identifies the stories of the people and systems involved in a process.

Detail is added as we learn more about the project

The project can be an existing application or a new application.

--
#Why Story Map?

- Build shared understanding
- Encourage discovery before implementation
- Include all stakeholders in the discussion
- Organize work to be done

#When to Story Map?

- When you have questions about an application or process

- When you begin new work

- Preferably before you being development

--

#Where?

A large, clear wall or whiteboard.

--

#You'll need 

- painter's tape
- markers
- post-its (many colors)

--
#User Story

"A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a
description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user
story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story
helps to create a simplified description of a requirement."

~Wikipedia

--

#User Story Structure

As a {role}, I want {feature} so that {reason}.

--

#The Story Map

Composed of many user stories.

Tells the story of your application.

It can include parts of the story that happen outside of the application.

--

#Your Morning

List the first five tasks or activities you did this morning after getting out of bed.

--

#Building the narrative

Let's put them together to build a morning story!

- There are variations between people, days of week, local and out-of-towners

--

#Anatomy of a Story Map

- Users => actors in the story

- Backbone => overview of the project; built from user stories; the frame;

- User Tasks => add detail to the story

- Objectives => organize and prioritize stories

--

#Building the map

Begin with user stories and work toward a narrative flow

Later, distill the story to build your backbone

#What you get from this

--

#Thorough Discovery

- Understand the full process
  - Understand "why" steps are needed in the process
  - Talk about things inside and outside of the app
- Simplify and lower risk at implementation
  - Lowers the questions at the phase of implementation
  - Limits Feature Creep (beginning implementation w/o understanding, new features come in)
- Better estimates 

Discovery is cheaper at the beginning of a project, than during implementation

--

#Focus on Outcomes

- Prioritize features based on the problem they solve 
- Implement only what solves the problem or meets the objective
 
(instead of perceived importance)

### A textual example

Content can be written in **Markdown!** New lines no longer need two angle brackets.

This will be in a separate paragraph

--

### A list of things

* Item 1
* Item B
* Item gamma

No need for multiple templates!
