    <title>Pulling Up Your Legacy By Its Bootstraps</title>

    <meta name="description"
          content="Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to support an application built on an older framework. Upgrading isn't an option. The code is untested and nowhere near best practices or standards. In this session we'll talk about strategies to incorporate modern PHP coding practices to add features and functionality and retiring the older code in pieces. We'll review specific examples and code from a real project where we bootstrapped an early CodeIgniter app.">

            <p>&quot;A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a
                description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user
                story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story
                helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.&quot;</p>
