          content="User Story Mapping is a valuable tool that gives you strategies to view features alongside the problems they solve. It is a powerful approach that allows many people to prioritize features, regardless of technical expertise. Instead of planning our project as a building that we must build with a strong foundation, we begin to plan as a vehicle. This focus delivers the Most Valuable Features to the customer by answering the question, “What’s Your Skateboard?”">

                We're going to talk about a lot of really helpful ideas I've gleaned from this book.  My map examples will be more trivial than what he shares, because I was nervous I could fit them readably on the slides.  There is a lot that you can learn from this book.  He shares a lot of project stories, successes and losses, so I recommend it.  I'm going to share with you the biggest ideas that helped us change our strategies.

                Just a few fun facts about me: I've been writing PHP since 1999. I've also got a lot of hobbies.  I spend time with my family; we hike and paddle; I like to make things like blankets, silly costumes, and music.  And I'm a retired Carolina Rollergirl.<br><br>

                I'm also a developer at NC State.  We maintain about 70 legacy PHP applications that support the Business of the College of Engineering.  We have reduced that from about 90 applications 3.5 yrs ago when I joined the team, and we only have 3 fulltime developers tasked with this.

                Historically, we would have a brief meeting with the customer where we discussed client needs.  Then, we developed for a few months and delivered something that solved a problem, but didn't always solve THEIR problems or fulfill a need.  As we noticed this, we were looking for techniques to improve our communication and effectiveness.  User Story Mapping taught us a lot of things.

            <p>A diagram of a project that tells the story of the people and systems involved in a process.</p>
            <p>Detail is added as we learn more about the project</p>
            <p>The map can be built for an existing application or a new application.</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                <li>A visual of the application and the processes that happen inside and outside of your application.</li>
                <li>It highlights areas where you need to know more, and allows you to investigate that before you begin implementing.</li>
                <li>This technique works for new and existing projects of any size.</li>

                Structurally, your map will look a bit like this.
                The story flows from left to right
                Details and steps are built from the top down.
                You can involve user types that are users of the application or even a background system process
                When we get the full story described, we will begin to slice it.  But we'll talk about that soon.

            <p>At least one knowledgeable person from each group of stakeholders</p>
            <aside class="notes">
                Who do you want to bring to your story mapping discussion?
                Anyone who knows the processes you're automating.
                The room should actually have fewer programmers in the beginning unless they are there to ask questions.  Developers shouldn't fill in the story.  You cannot learn what your application is doing or supposed to be doing from people who don't use it to solve a problem they have.

                Any time you are doing work and don't know the business process behind it.  The application can already exist, and you can use this to discover how new features or fixes should be implemented.

                <li><strong>midgame strategy</strong> - fill in and round out features; support optional steps; implement tough business rules; continue testing the product usability</li>
                <li><strong>endgame</strong> - refine: make it look more polished and efficient; it’s here that you’ll have feedback from users that can be applied.</li>

            <p>&quot;A user story is a tool used in Agile software development to capture a
                description of a software feature from an end-user perspective. The user
                story describes the type of user, what they want and why. A user story
                helps to create a simplified description of a requirement.&quot;</p>
